>:exclamation: WARNING: This is a test environment, do not use for production.

This repository includes [DTDL](https://aka.ms/dtdl) models that are made publicly available on [https://devicemodeltest.azureedge.net/](https://devicemodeltest.azureedge.net/). These models can be used to create Azure [IoT Plug and Play](https://aka.ms/iotpnp) solutions.

Related tools, samples, and specs can be found in the [Azure/iot-plugandplay-models-tools](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models-tools) repo. The current repo only stores **test** DTDL models.

## Submit a model

1. Fork the public GitHub repo: [https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models-test](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models-test).
1. Clone the forked repo. Optionally create a new branch to keep your changes isolated from the `main` branch.
1. Add the new interfaces to the `dtmi` folder using the folder/filename convention. See the [add-model](#add-models) tool below.
1. Validate the models locally using the [scripts to validate changes](#validate-files) section.
1. Commit the changes locally and push to your fork.
1. From your fork, create a PR that targets the `main` branch.
1. Review the [PR requirements](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models/blob/main/pr-reqs.md)

The PR triggers a series of GitHub actions that will validate the new submitted interfaces, and make sure your PR satisfies all the checks.

Microsoft will respond to a PR with all checks in 3 business days.

## Tools

The repo contains scripts to help managing the repo, with tools to add and valdidate files locally.

> Note: These scripts require NodeJs. Don't forget to initialize the dependencies with:

```cmd
npm install
```

### add-models

If you have your model already stored in json files, you can use the add-model script to add those to the `dtmi/` folder with the right file name.

```cmd
npm run add-model <full-path-to-dtd.json>
```

Watch the console output for any error messages.

### validate-files

Checks the folder and file names are expected from the root `@id`

```cmd
npm run validate-files <list of files to validate>
```

### validate-ids

Checks if all `@id` are nested under the root id.

```cmd
npm run validate-ids <list of files to validate>
```

### validate-deps

Checks if all the external dependencies in `extends` and `@Component` exists in the `dtmi/` folder.

```cmd
npm run validate-deps <list of files to validate>
```

### validate-models

Checks if the models can be successfully validated by the .NET DTDL parser.

You can run the [DTDL Validation Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/DTDL-Validator) to validate your models locally

## Consuming

Any HTTP client can consume the models by just applying the [convention](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models-tools/wiki/Resolution-Convention) to translate *DTMI ids* to relative paths:

Eg, the interface:

```cmd
dtmi:azure:DeviceManagement:DeviceInformation;1
```

can be retrieved from [here](https://devicemodeltest.azureedge.net/dtmi/azure/devicemanagement/deviceinformation-1.json):

```cmd
https://devicemodeltest.azureedge.net/dtmi/azure/devicemanagement/deviceinformation-1.json
```

There are samples for .NET and Node in the [iot-plugandplay-models-tools](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models-tools) with code you can use to acquire models from your custom IoT solution.
